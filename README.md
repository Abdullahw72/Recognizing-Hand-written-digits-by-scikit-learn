# Recognizing-Hand-written-digits-by-scikit-learn

Handwritten text recognition has been an issue since the earliest automatic computers were required to distinguish individual characters in handwritten manuscripts.
Python provides a solution for this problem by the use of the package, scikit-learn.

This is a basic project for hand written digits recognition model for a virtual internship which I was a part of, and I performed the following tasks:

- Model Training

- Result Analysis



In the attached Jupyter Notebook file, I have completed a lot of different analysis to prove this hypothesis, and I will be attaching a blog referring to my resultant analysis of this problem in a future commit.
